  "summary": "Diff updates backend and frontend to use exact admin credentials joana/joana123 and adds post-login permission refetch logic, but evidence is insufficient that AdminAccessGate was updated to provide the required blocked-state navigation/re-login actions, and some new AdminLoginPage UI strings appear unrelated (English copy).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-50",
      "requirement": "Ensure AdminAccessGate provides an auth-required state with a working button to navigate to Admin Login when blocked, and offers a working re-login action that clears validation and routes to Admin Login when authenticated but lacking backend admin permission.",
      "reason": "The diff shows changes to login flow and profile owner-panel navigation, but does not show any changes to the AdminAccessGate component itself (or equivalent gate UI) implementing the required blocked-state buttons/actions. File summaries mention Inventory page passes onNavigate to the gate, but do not provide evidence of the gate rendering the required CTAs.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions ControleDeEstoquePage passes onNavigate to gate)",
        "frontend/src/pages/ControleDeEstoquePage.tsx (referenced only via summary, no gate UI evidence)"

      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on fixing admin credentials and access flow; it does not request changing UI language/copy. The diff shows multiple English strings in the admin login page.",

  "summary": "The diff implements the requested admin credential change end-to-end: backend default password is now exactly \"joana 123\" and backend comparison preserves internal spaces; the frontend hook trims only leading/trailing whitespace (preserving internal spaces) before calling `verifyAdminLogin`.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced a backend state migration module and wired `backend/main.mo` to use it to overwrite `adminPassword` to \"joana 123\" on migration.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest allowed adding `backend/migration.mo` only if strictly required for upgrades, but no requirement explicitly requested adding/wiring a migration system; this is additional implementation beyond the stated requirements.",
